# Spectrum

Some data consists of regions along a spectrum rather than explicit,
discrete valuesâ€”e.g., gender identification, moral culpability, judicial
standards of review, and so on. Nevertheless, we might want to visualize
this data somehow. For that, we can use a spectrum bar:

<Story
	name="Spectrum"
	args={{
		colors: ["lime", "gold", "red"],
		alternateBy: 2,
		textPadding: 4,
		data: [
			"De Novo",
			"Clearly Erroneous",
			"Reasonableness",
			"Arbitrary & Capricious",
			"Abuse of Discretion",
			"Reasonable Jury",
			"No Review",
		],
	}}>
	{Template.bind({})}
</Story>

<ArgsTable story="Spectrum" />
