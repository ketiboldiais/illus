# Illus

`Illus` (short for "Illustration") is a component library for rendering
math- and computer science-related diagrams. Illus grew out of a need to
quickly create diagrams during lectures and seminars. With the advent of
tools like NextJS, MDX, and KaTeX, attendees can write:

```md
<Plot functions={[ { f: (x) => Math.sin(x) }, ]}/>
```

to render:

<Plot functions={[{ f: (x) => Math.sin(x) }]} />
