# Illus

`Illus` (short for "Illustration") is a React component library for
rendering math- and computer science-related diagrams. `Illus` grew out of
a need to quickly create diagrams during lectures and seminars. Admittedly,
there's a strong correlation between taking notes by hand and a deeper
retention, or understanding, of the material. Although, there's also
evidence supporting not taking notes at all, but let's not go there.

Debate aside, we generally don't like reading other people's notes. One
colleague redefines pain via handwriting, the other the English language
via abbreviation. Worse, rewriting those notes with LaTeX or some other
software-of-choice can be a painstaking process. We rewrite our notes in
some text editor. If we encounter a graph, we might move to Python, Matlab,
or Mathematica. Diagram of a linked list, flowchart, or tree? Perhaps
Inkscape. All of this movement between different tools deviates from what
we really just want to doâ€”produce a more polished version of our materials.

The idea behind `Illus` is, we want to write something like this:

<SampleDocRaw />

to render this:

<SampleDoc />
