# Illus

`Illus` is a React component library for rendering math and computer science
diagrams. The following diagrams are currently supported:

- Basic data structures:
  1. Static arrays
  2. Queues
  3. Stacks
  4. Circular queues
  5. Doubly-linked lists
  6. Linked lists (more specifically, singly-linked lists)
  7. Circular linked lists
  8. Matrices (multidimensional arrays)
- Graphs:
  1. General graph
  2. Bipartite graphs
  3. Digraphs
- Trees:
  1. Binary trees
  2. Horizontal trees
  3. k-ary trees
- Function plots:
  - 2-dimensional function plots
  - 3-dimensional function plots
- Charts:
  1. Bar plots
  2. Line plots
  3. Bubble packs
  4. Hex maps (currently U.S. map only)
  5. Scatter plots
  6. Spectrums
